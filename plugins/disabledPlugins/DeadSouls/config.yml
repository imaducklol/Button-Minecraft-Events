# <time> How frequently should auto-save of the soul database occur (only if modified and not more frequently than once per second)
# never      = saving happens only on server restart (not generally recommended, unless you are 100% sure that your server never crashes or when you don't care about item loss and duplication)
# otherwise  = plugin will attempt to save periodically, after this time interval passes
#              0s is recommended for servers with infrequent deaths
#              1m or 5m might be sensible values for large servers
# Note that the auto-save happens mostly on an off-thread, so it is unlikely to cause any lag,
# unless the amount of souls you have is really enormous (multiple thousands).

# How to pick this value: Unless you have performance problems when players die
#  and you know that a lot of players die in a short bursts on your server, keep it at 0s.
#  Otherwise, there are two things to consider:
#   The value must be large enough, that multiple players frequently die within that time span.
#     Example: On a hunger games server, 20 players die within first 5 minutes, then the rate slows down. 5m would be a reasonable auto-save period.
#   The value must be as small as possible to prevent losing/duplicating items on server crash.
#     Risk of item loss or duplication is inevitable on server crashes, even in vanilla, but auto-saving once per hour may be unwise.
auto-save: 0s
